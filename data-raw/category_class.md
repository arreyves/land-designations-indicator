Resource Restriction Classification

The restriction for industries (Forestry, Oil and Gas, and Mining). These classifications are based on a combination of level of approvals required for activities to occur (i.e. regional director, Cabinet, RED, ADM) and the level of activates restricted (i.e. WHA’s may specify specific details).
Restrictions are based on legislative restrictions, rather than functional agreements, and indicate what is potentially possible within the land designation.

Full – prohibits activities of all kind. For example National Parks, or where specific legislation is defined (Creston Valley Wildlife Management Act).
High – Requires high level approval (ADM), or activities are highly restricted for example forestry harvesting within no harvest area (WHA, UWR).
Medium – Requires some level of approvals at regional or higher level. Some restrictions may be general or vague application.
Low – requires minimal approval (i.e. B.C. Recreation
None – No specific limits or restrictions specified.
