Resource Restriction Classification

Each land designation is classified based on the level of restriction of resource activity as described within relevant legislation and regulations. Classifications are determined per industry type (Forestry, Oil and Gas, and Mining) and range from Full restriction to No restriction. 

- Full 
  – fully prohibits an activity. For example commercial forestry is fully restricted within a National Parks, or mining and oil and gas exploration within the Creston Valley Wildlife Management Area. 
- High 
  – Activities are highly restricted for example forestry harvesting within no harvest area (WHA, UWR).
- Medium 
  – Some restrictions may apply but general or vague application.
- Low 
  – Activities generally allowed with some limitations or specific requirements
- None
  – No specific limits or restrictions specified.
