# Analysis of land designations that contribute to conservation

This repository contains R code that calculates summaries of the amount of land 
designated in B.C. that contributes to conservation. It supports this 
[Environmental Reporting BC indicator](http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/soe/indicators/land/land-designations.html).

## Usage

### R packages required:

Other than `bcmaps` and `envreportutils`, all required packages are available from CRAN


- bcmaps (install with `devtools::install_github("bcgov/bcmaps")`)
- envreportutils (install with `devtools::install_github("bcgov/envreportutils")`)
- geojsonio
- rmapshaper
- feather
- readr
- dplyr
- tidyr
- sf
- ggplot2
- ggpolypath
- magrittr
- ggthemes
- svglite

### Data

The inputs required to run this analysis were created 
using the [designatedlands](https://github.com/bcgov/designatedlands/)
tool with the config files contained in the `data-raw` directory:

- `config_2020-10-08.cfg`
- `sources_designations.csv`
- `sources_supporting.csv`

```
conda env create -f environment.yml

conda activate designatedlands

docker run -d \
 -p 5432:5432 \
 -e PG_USER=designatedlands \
 -e PG_PASSWORD=designatedlands \
 -e PG_DATABASE=designatedlands \
 --name=dlpg \
 crunchydata/crunchy-postgres-appdev
 
python designatedlands.py download
python designatedlands.py download config_2020-10-08.cfg
python designatedlands.py preprocess config_2020-10-08.cfg
python designatedlands.py process-vector config_2020-10-08.cfg
python designatedlands.py dump
python designatedlands.py process-raster config_2020-10-08.cfg

```

Outputs are stored in the `data-raw/outputs` folder:

- `designatedlands.gpkg`
- `forest_restriction.tif`
- `designatedlands.tif`
- `og_restriction.tif`
- `mine_restriction.tif`

can be obtained by downloading the data via the [B.C. Data Catalogue](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/3eedf0da-0c1d-4917-aff5-1eb8f59736bc). They are released under the [Open Government Licence - British Columbia](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=A519A56BC2BF44E4A008B33FCF527F61):

- `designatedlands.gpkg` - the land designations layer
- `lands_bec.gpkg` - the land designations layer intersected with BEC.
- `lands_eco.gpkg`- the land designations layer intersected with ecosections.

Place these in the `data` folder of this repository. You will also require `BEC_BIOGEOCLIMATIC_POLY.gdb` from [here](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/biogeoclimatic-ecosystem-classification-bec-map) and 
`ERC_ECOSECTIONS_SP.gdb` from [here](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/ecosections-ecoregion-ecosystem-classification-of-british-columbia)

The [`data-raw`](data-raw) folder contains a file [`sources.csv`](data-raw/sources.csv) that lists all of the source land designation layers used in the analysis.

### Running the analysis

- Run the `01_clean.R` file to prepare the data. Note that this will take a long time (several hours)
- Run the `02_analysis.R` file to calculate the summaries. 
- Summary csv files are copied to the `out` directory, and summary tabular objects for use
in the [land designations Shiny app](https://github.com/bcgov/land-designations-shinyapp)
are copied to the `out-shiny` directory.
- Run the `03_output_static.R` script to create outputs (png maps and graphs etc).
- Run the `04_output_shiny.R` scrip to generate the objects required for the shiny app.
This will also copy the files from `out-shiny` to the `../land-designations-shinyapp/app/data` 
folder, assuming the folder exists in same parent directory as this repository
