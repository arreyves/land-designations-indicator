Analysis of land designations that contribute to conservation
=============================================================

This repository contains R code that calculates summaries of the amount of land designated in B.C. that contributes to conservation. It supports this [Environmental Reporting BC indicator]().

Usage
-----

### R packages required:

Other than `bcmaps`\*, all required packages are available from CRAN

-   rgdal
-   sp
-   rgeos
-   raster
-   maptools
-   bcmaps \*(install with `devtools::install_github("bcgov/bcmaps")`)
-   geojsonio
-   rmapshaper
-   feather
-   readr
-   dplyr
-   tidyr
-   ggplot2
-   ggpolypath

### Data

Source data is obtained by running the script [here](https://github.com/bcgov/conservationlands) The outputs from that script should be:

-   `land_designations.gdb` - the land designations layer
-   `lands_bec.gdb` - the land designations layer intersected with BEC (using the `overlay` command in the conservationlands tool)
-   `lands_ecosections.gdb`- the land designations layer intersected with ecosections (using the `overlay` command in the conservationlands tool)

Place these in the `data` folder of this repository.

The [`data-raw`](data-raw) folder contains a file [`sources.csv`](data-raw/sources.csv) that lists all of the source land designation layers used in the analysis.

### Running the analysis

-   Run the `01_clean.R` file to prepare the data. Note that this will take a long time (several hours)
-   Run the `02_analysis.R` file to calculate the summaries.
-   Summary csv files are copied to the `out` directory, and summary objects for use in the [land designations Shiny app](https://github.com/bcgov/land-designations-shinyapp) are copied to the `out-shiny` directory.
-   The `output.R` file will copy the files from `out-shiny` to the `../land-designations-shinyapp/app/data` folder, assuming the folder exists in same parent directory as this repository

Pathway to open source
----------------------

Once the data are available, this repo will be moved to the bcgov org and developed in the open.
